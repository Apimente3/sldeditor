The SLD Editor is a Java desktop application that allows the creation and editing of [OGC Styled Layer Descriptors](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sld) interactively using a graphical user interface.<p>
The application provides a toolset to improve workflow.

Main features include:
* Vector (point, line and polygon) symbol editing
* Raster symbol editing
* Text symbol editing
* Functions, filters, expressions, transformations all configurable via dialogs.
* GeoServer vendor options supported:
  * Labelling
  * WKT geometry
  * Windbarbs
* Integration with GeoServer
* Map viewer
* Ability to convert Esri MXD files to SLD files (requires separate licensed components not supplied as part of this project)

## Background
Background to the project can be found [here](http://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2016/abstracts.html#improving-open-source-gis-workflow-with-a-sld-editor).

The project was presented at [![FOSS4G UK 2016](http://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2016/images/foss4guk_2016_logo.png)](http://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2016/)

## Project State
The application is not complete, however is at the stage where I need to know whether there is enough interest from the open source GIS community to complete it.<p>
